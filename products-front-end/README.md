## Product-List-Front-End

To start the app, fork and clone this repository then cd into the "products-front-end" folder and run "npm install" in your terminal. One the packages are installed you can start the app by running "npm run dev" in your terminal and you can view it by going to your localhost. If you started the server in the "product-list" folder you should be able to see all of the products in the store and have the ability to search and sort by price and category.

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.
